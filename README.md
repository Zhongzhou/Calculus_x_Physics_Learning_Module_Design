# Calculus x Physics Learning Module Design
This Repository contains prototype design of online learning modules at the intersection of University level Calculus and Physics.

## Structure of Online Learning Modules
* This repository contains one prototype learning unit with 3 Calculus focused learning modules and 2 Physics focused learning modules. Each module contains both instructional materials and an expandable isomorphic problem bank with 10+ problems, both created with the assistance of generative AI.
    * Calculus focused modules:
        * Topic: Derivative as the limit of differences
        * Each problem in isomorphic problem bank builds a math model for a physically feasible situation.
        * Instead of always using y=f(x), math expression used in each problem is context appropriate.
    * Physics focused modules:
        * Topic: Velocity and Acceleration in 1D
        * Involve more sophisticated calculus than most existing Physics I textbook
        * Connects naturally from math modules
