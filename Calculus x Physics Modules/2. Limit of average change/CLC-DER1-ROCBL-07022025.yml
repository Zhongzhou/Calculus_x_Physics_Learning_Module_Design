    title: Rate of change by limits.
    bank_id: CLC-DER1-ROCBL-07022025 #Subject-Unit-Abbreviation_of_title_or_any_string-date
    description: |-
        This problem bank introduces students to the concept of instantaneous rate of change through real-world STEM scenarios. Each problem begins with a nonlinear equation describing how a quantity changes with respect to time, distance, or altitude. To support students who have not yet learned formal derivative rules, the problems use polynomial approximations to model the behavior near a specific point. Students practice computing the rate of change by forming a difference quotient and evaluating its limit, laying the conceptual foundation for understanding derivatives.

    generation prompts: 
        # The user uploads the yaml of the average rate of change problem bank.
        # The prompts are designed for the first 5 questions. Re-use the prompt chain with slight modification for the remainder of the question, in 5 question batches to avoid deterioration of output.
        - prompt 1: | # using o3. 4o is not smart enough to do this
            Here is a yaml file which contain many problems. Each problem has a different context and contains one equation that determines the rate of change of a measurement with regard to a variable. Each problem also specified the values of all the constant parameters, and a range of change of the variable.
            The goal is to modify those problems to teach students about the basic idea of derivatives. However, students at this stage only knows how to compute limits for simple polynomial functions, but don't know how to compute limits. So we need to simplify the main equation into polynomial format. As a first step, for each of the first five questions, do the following:
                1. Select a value of the variable close to the middle of the specified range of change.
                2. If the governing equation is not in a polynomial format, derive the Tyler expansion of the equation in the vicinity of the chosen value, to the second order term. Preferably use python and SymPy to do the derivation.
                3. Simplify the Tyler expansion into the form of y = A + Bx + Cx^2, with A, B and C being numerical parameters (use the variable in the problem, not x). Preferably use python to ensure the accuracy of parameters calculated.
                4. If the governing equation is already in a polynomial format, present it as a simple polynomial with numerical coefficients, also using python for accuracy of parameters.
        - prompt 2: | # use GPT 4.5 for better writing.
                Now write modified versions of the problem body of the first five problems according to the following steps:
                1. Introduce the context and the main equation with numerical parameters.
                2. After introducing the main relation, in the context of the original problem, modify the text to say that we are interested in knowing the rate of change in the [measurement] at [the value of the variable we chose (midpoint in the range)]
                2. explain that to simplify the calculation, around [the value that we chose above], the above relation can be approximated by [the polynomial we just derived above]. 
                3. Ask students to find how the measurement changes around a given variable. Write the question in the problem context such as "how fast the coffee is cooling 7 minutes after being poured"
                4. Prompt students to first calculate an expression for the average rate of change over a small interval from x to x + \Delta x [replace with the variable used in the problem], then take the limit as \Delta [variable] goes to zero. Do not display additional information regarding the form of  the difference quotient.
                Write the text, don't use a programming language. 

        - prompt 3: | # o3 for accurate reasoning
            Now let's generate the solution for each problem. First, find the correct numerical answer by simply taking the derivative of the approximate polynomial expression, and calculating the value at the selected point.

        - prompt 4: | # GPT-4.5 for better writing. o3 produces very terse solutions.
            Now that we have the correct answer, write a concise, student facing solution for each problem. The solution should start by calculating the average rate of change using a difference quotient, and then taking the limit. Explain each step in the solution.

    title: Coffee Cooling Rate
    points: 3
    text: |
      A freshly poured cup of hot coffee initially at \(85^\circ\text{C}\) is cooling down in a room kept at a constant \(22^\circ\text{C}\). The temperature of the coffee <latex>T(t)</latex> after <latex>t</latex> minutes can be modeled accurately by the equation:

      <latex>
      T(t) = 22 + 63 e^{-0.03 t}
      </latex>

      We are interested in finding out how quickly the coffee is cooling at exactly <latex>t = 7.5</latex> minutes. To simplify our calculation, we approximate the temperature near that time using the polynomial:

      <latex>
      T(t) \approx 84.8989 - 1.8488\,t + 0.02264\,t^2
      </latex>

      Using this simplified model, determine how fast the coffee is cooling <latex>7.5</latex> minutes after being poured. 

      First, compute an expression for the average rate of change in temperature over a small interval from <latex>t</latex> to <latex>t + \Delta t</latex>, and then find the instantaneous rate of cooling by taking the limit as <latex>\Delta t</latex> approaches zero.

          **Step 1: Set up the average rate of change**  
          We approximate the temperature near <latex>t = 7.5</latex> minutes by:
          <latex>
          T(t) \approx 84.8989 - 1.8488\,t + 0.02264\,t^2
          </latex>

          The average rate of change in temperature over a small interval from <latex>7.5</latex> to <latex>7.5 + \Delta t</latex> is:
          <latex>
          \frac{T(7.5 + \Delta t) - T(7.5)}{\Delta t}
          </latex>

          **Step 2: Evaluate and simplify**  
          After expanding and simplifying this expression and taking the limit as <latex>\Delta t \to 0</latex>, we find:
          <latex>
          -1.8488 + 0.04528 \times 7.5 = -1.51
          </latex>

          **Final Answer:** The coffee is cooling at approximately <latex>1.51^\circ\mathrm{C}</latex> per minute at <latex>t = 7.5</latex> minutes.

      A bacterial colony initially contains 500 bacteria and is growing rapidly. The number of bacteria <latex>N(t)</latex> after <latex>t</latex> hours is given by:

      <latex>
      N(t) = 500 e^{0.4 t}
      </latex>

      We are interested in the rate of bacterial growth at exactly <latex>t = 1.5</latex> hours. To simplify the calculation, we use the polynomial approximation:

      <latex>
      N(t) \approx 528.4145 + 145.7695\,t + 72.8848\,t^2

      Using this simplified equation, determine how fast the bacterial colony is growing <latex>1.5</latex> hours after observation began. 

      Start by writing an expression for the average rate of change in the number of bacteria over a small interval from <latex>t</latex> to <latex>t + \Delta t</latex>, then take the limit as <latex>\Delta t</latex> approaches zero.

          N(t) \approx 528.4145 + 145.7695\,t + 72.8848\,t^2

          The average rate of change from <latex>t = 1.5</latex> to <latex>t + \Delta t</latex> is:
          <latex>
          \frac{N(1.5 + \Delta t) - N(1.5)}{\Delta t}
          </latex>

          **Step 2: Evaluate and simplify**  
          Expanding and simplifying, then taking the limit as <latex>\Delta t \to 0</latex> gives:
          <latex>
          145.7695 + 145.7696 \times 1.5 = 364.42
          </latex>

      M(t) \approx 99.6401 - 4.8153\,t + 0.09260\,t^2
      </latex>

      Using this model, determine how fast the mass of the radioactive sample is decreasing <latex>6</latex> hours after observation began. 

      Start by writing an expression for the average rate of change in mass over a small interval from <latex>t</latex> to <latex>t + \Delta t</latex>, and then take the limit as <latex>\Delta t</latex> approaches zero.

          We approximate the drug concentration <latex>C(t)</latex> around <latex>t=1.5</latex> h by the polynomial:

          <latex>
          C(t) \approx 98.91 - 27.74\,t + 2.87\,t^2
          </latex>

          **Step 1: Average rate of change**  
          Calculate the average rate of change from <latex>1.5</latex> to <latex>1.5 + \Delta t</latex>:

          <latex>
          \frac{C(1.5 + \Delta t)-C(1.5)}{\Delta t}
          </latex>

          **Step 2: Take the limit**  
          Take the limit as <latex>\Delta t \to 0</latex>:

          <latex>
          \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}\frac{[98.91 - 27.74(1.5+\Delta t) + 2.87(1.5+\Delta t)^2] - [98.91 - 27.74(1.5) + 2.87(1.5)^2]}{\Delta t}
          </latex>

          Evaluating the limit gives

          <latex>
          -27.74 + 5.74(1.5) = -19.13
          </latex>

          **Final Answer:**  
          The drug concentration is **decreasing at approximately 19.13 mg L\(^{-1}\) per hour** at <latex>t = 1.5</latex> h.

      At a certain location, ocean-water temperature in °C at depth \(d\) m is  

      <latex>T(d) = 2 + 23 e^{-0.05 d}</latex>  

      We want to know how quickly the temperature is changing at <latex>d = 7.5 \text{ m}</latex>.  
      Around this depth the relationship can be approximated by
