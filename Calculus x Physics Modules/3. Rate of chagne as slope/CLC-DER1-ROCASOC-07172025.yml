    generation prompts: # The following are the prompts that generated the questions in the problem bank.
        - prompt 1: | #gpt-o4-mini-high
            I would like to create different versions of a math problem involving the value and slope of three points on a curve, labeled A, B and C. The question is about comparing the rate of change at three different points. Step 1, please list all possible relations between the slope of the three points, for example, A > B > C, or A = B < C.
        - prompt 2: | #gpt-o4-mini-high
            Next, for each of the 13 relation about the slope of the three points, I want to generate 2 possible relationships between the value (y-coordinate) of the three points. The requirements are that: 
            1. The y-coordinate relation must be written in the same order as the slope relation. (i.e. A,B,C) 
            2. For each comparison operator in the slope relation, replace with a different operator for value. For example, replace ">" with either "<" or "=". 
            3. Avoid creating non-determinant relations such as "A < B > C", or "B > A < C". 
            4. Avoid all equal relations such as "A = B = C" for the value relation.
            Output the relations in a "long" table form with one column for slope and one column for value. 
        - prompt 3: |
            Next step, for each row of the above table, come up with randomized parameters for the slope and value (y-coordinate) of each prompt. The requirements are: 1. the slope parameters are between -1.5 to 1.5, and the y-coordinates between 2 and 8. 2. The relation between the slope and value parameters should follow the relations listed in the table. 3. The difference between every two parameters should be greater than 1 unless they need to be equal to each other. 
            After that, add three x-coordinates to each row. The x-coordinates should be relatively uniformly distributed in the range of 0-10, with some level of randomness, and with x_A < x_B < x_C.
        - prompt 4: |
            Now generate one plot for each row in the above table. Each plot should contain the following elements:
            1. A smooth curve that passes through all three points and has the corresponding slope at the three points, using the piecewise cubit Hermite method. The curve need to start from x = 0 and end at x = 10.
            2. Highlight the three points using three round dots, and label them A, B and C according to the rows. (do not use cross!)
            3. The curve and the dots should be relatively thick to make the value and slope visually significant to the viewer. The dots should be thicker than the curve.
            Name the diagrams q-1 through q-26, and create a downloadable zip file for all the diagrams
        - prompt 5: |
            Generate a new table that contains the following columns:
            "Question": from q-1 to q-16
            "Correct Answer": Contains the slope relations.
            "Value Distractor": Contains the value relations.
            "Distractor 1": A different relation between A, B and C.
            "Distractor 2": Another different relation between A, B and C.
            Distractor 1 and Distractor 2 needs to be different than the Correct Answer and Value Distractor, and not contain non-determinant forms such as "A < B > C" or "A > B < C".
        - prompt 6: |
            For each row, come up with a context in which a measurement is changing with a time or distance variable. For example, position is changing with time, or concentration/intensity is changing with distance. Since the curves are generated randomly, the context should be suitable for arbitrary variation, such as involving unknown new material or position of a randomly moving object or animal. 
            Avoid familiar or known context such as human body or uniform materials such as water. 
            Also avoid using rates as the measurement, such as velocity, acceleration or flow rate, that are already derivatives of other measures. Use variables such as position or density, which have meaningful rates of change.  
            The context can involve new, unknown or non-uniform substances. List the brief description of the context situation and the variables changing in two new columns in the above table, and add the columns behind the "Question" column. 
        - prompt 7: | # open a new chat to avoid context window being too long. Also generate 5 problem bodies at a time to avoid output window limitation. Copy the generated output into a markdown file manually (for the same reason).
            For each row in the table, write a multiple choice math question according to the context and variables according to the explanation below:
            1. The question presents students with a diagram of a curve with three points, and asks students to compare the rate of change of the measurement (the slope of the curve) at three different points on the diagram.
            2. State that scientists, researchers, students, etc. measured the measurement value as it changes, and plotted it on the diagram. 
            3. Also add a sentence that justifies the fluctuating nature of the curve, such a the material is highly non-uniform, or the motion is varying greatly, etc. according to the context. 
            4. State that they are interested in/need to know how rapidly the measurement variable is changing at the three different time or position or distance etc. on the diagram.
            5. Ask students to choose which of the following relations most closely represent the ranking of the rate of change. Use context appropriate language for the concept of rate of change such as "how fast it is moving" or "how rapidly it is changing".
            4. For now, just write the question id and the problem body, not the choice items.

            Start with the first five questions.

        - prompt 8: | #Open a new chat and upload both the table and the md file generated above.
            Here is a csv table containing problem id, problem context, and problem choice items. The markdown file contains all the problem bodies. I would like to you to write the problem body and problem choices according ot the following formatting instruction: {replace with yaml formatting prompt content}
            For the problem body, add a clarification statement that negative rate of change is ranked lower than positive rate of change. 
            For the solution, draft a simple solution explaining that the rate of change corresponds to the slope of the curve at each point, rather than the value. Keep in mind that negative slopes are smaller than positive slopes.

    title: Rate of Change of Density in Non-Uniform Foam
    points: 1
    text: |
      Scientists measured the density of a highly non-uniform, experimental porous foam sample as a function of distance along its length and plotted the results on the diagram below. Due to the irregular structure of the foam, the density fluctuates greatly from point to point along the sample. The diagram shows the density curve with three marked positions, labeled A, B, and C. The researchers are interested in knowing how rapidly the density is changing at each of these three positions.

      **Which of the following best describes the ranking of how quickly the density is changing at points A, B, and C?**

      *Clarification:* When ranking the rate of change, remember that a negative rate of change is ranked lower than a positive rate of change.

      general: |
        The rate of change at each point is determined by the slope of the curve at that position. The steeper the slope (positive or negative), the greater the rate of change. Remember, the rate of change refers to how quickly the density value increases or decreases at each point, not the actual density value itself. A positive rate of change means the density is increasing, while a negative rate means it is decreasing. Negative rates of change are always ranked lower than positive ones. For this question, the correct ranking is: <latex>A > B > C</latex>.

    title: Speed Ranking of a Nano-Drone in Unpredictable Environment
    points: 1
    text: |
      A group of researchers tracked the position of a nano-drone as it navigated through a highly unpredictable environment. They plotted the position of the drone as a function of time on the diagram below. Because the drone’s movement is influenced by sudden gusts and obstacles, its path varies significantly over time. The diagram marks three moments in time—A, B, and C—on the position vs. time curve. The team needs to determine at which moment the drone is moving the fastest.
      **Which of the following most accurately ranks the speed (rate of change of position) of the drone at points A, B, and C?**

      *Clarification:* When ranking the rate of change, remember that a negative rate of change is ranked lower than a positive rate of change.

        The rate of change of position is the speed of the drone at each marked point, corresponding to the steepness of the curve (slope) at each location. To rank the speed, we compare how rapidly the drone’s position is changing at A, B, and C. A larger slope (steeper curve) means a faster speed. Negative slopes (downward movement) are considered lower than positive ones. For this problem, the correct ranking is: <latex>B > A > C</latex>.

    title: Population Density Change in Microfluidic Swarm
    points: 1
    text: |
      Biologists recorded the population density of a fast-moving swarm of microorganisms as it moved through a nutrient gradient in a microfluidic device. Because the swarm’s movement is chaotic and the environment is highly variable, the population density fluctuates in a complex pattern over distance. The graph below shows the population density versus distance, with points A, B, and C marked. The biologists are interested in knowing at which location the population density is changing the fastest.
      **Which of the following most closely represents the ranking of the rate of change of population density at points A, B, and C?**

      *Clarification:* When ranking the rate of change, remember that a negative rate of change is ranked lower than a positive rate of change.

        The rate of change in population density at each marked location is determined by the slope of the curve at A, B, and C. Larger slopes indicate more rapid changes. Negative slopes (decreasing density) are always ranked lower than positive slopes (increasing density). For this problem, the correct ranking is: <latex>B > A > C</latex>.
