    description: |-
      This problem bank contains isomorphic problems asking students to calculate instantaneous velocity using a difference quotient. Those problems are intended to be used in a physics learning module. The physics learning module is intended to accompany a calculus learning module prior to the introduction of the concept of derivatives.

        - prompt 1: |
            I would like to create problems that ask students to calculate instantaneous velocity at a point in time, given the position-time function as a 3rd order polynomial. First, generate 5 problems with the following requirements:
                1. The problem should be about an object moving in 1-D. Start with describing the context in 1-2 sentences. Avoid scenarios in which the acceleration is constant, such as free fall.
                2. Don't always use x(t) as the dependent variable, use context appropriate variables.
                3. Explain how the distance/height/length etc. is being measured. i.e. from which point is it being measured.
                4. Ask students to retain the sign of the answer to indicate the direction of velocity.
        - prompt 2: | # gpt-o4-mini
            Next, use python to solve each problem, list the title, the time and the velocity (with units) in a table. Then judge if the velocity is reasonable for the given problem context.
        - prompt 3: | # gpt-o4-mini
            For each problem for which the answer is unreasonable, update the polynomial so that the velocity found is reasonable for the problem context.
        - prompt 4: |
            Re-write those five problems in markdown format.
        - prompt 5: |
            Write student facing solutions for the first problem. The solutions should start with the definition of velocity as the change in position over time, then construct a difference quotient from t to t+\Delta t, and taking the limit as \Delta t goes to zero. Do not include numerical calculation details in the solution, but include the numerical answer from the table above.
        - prompt 5.1: |
            Write solutions for the next two problems in the same format.

    title: Water Droplet on a Leaf
    points: 3
    text: |
      A biologist is tracking a water droplet sliding along a long, slightly curved leaf. The distance <latex>s(t)</latex> (in cm) from the stem of the leaf to the droplet at time <latex>t</latex> seconds is given by:
      <latex>
      s(t) = 0.05\,t^3 - 0.3\,t^2 + 1.2\,t + 2
      </latex>
      What is the instantaneous velocity of the droplet at <latex>t = 4</latex> seconds?
      Retain the sign of your answer to indicate the direction of movement along the leaf.

        value: 1.20
        tolerance: 0.01

        general: |
          The instantaneous velocity at a specific moment is defined as the rate of change of position with respect to time. Mathematically, for a position function <latex>s(t)</latex>, the instantaneous velocity at time <latex>t</latex> is:
          <latex>
          v(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{s(t+\Delta t) - s(t)}{\Delta t}
          </latex>
          In this problem, the position of the water droplet as a function of time is given by:
          <latex>
          s(t) = 0.05\,t^3 - 0.3\,t^2 + 1.2\,t + 2
          </latex>
          To find the instantaneous velocity at <latex>t = 4\,\mathrm{s}</latex>:
          1. **Write the difference quotient:**
             <latex>
             v(4) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{s(4+\Delta t) - s(4)}{\Delta t}
             </latex>
          2. **Substitute the position function:**
             <latex>
             v(4) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{[0.05\,(4+\Delta t)^3 - 0.3\,(4+\Delta t)^2 + 1.2\,(4+\Delta t) + 2] - [0.05\,(4)^3 - 0.3\,(4)^2 + 1.2\,(4) + 2]}{\Delta t}
             </latex>
          3. **Take the limit as <latex>\Delta t \to 0</latex>:**
             This process gives the derivative of <latex>s(t)</latex> with respect to <latex>t</latex> at <latex>t = 4</latex>.
          4. **Final Answer:**
             The instantaneous velocity of the droplet at <latex>t = 4\,\mathrm{s}</latex> is
             <latex>v(4) = 1.20\,\mathrm{cm/s}</latex>.
             (The positive sign indicates the droplet is moving away from the stem at this instant.)

      <latex>
      d(t) = -0.1\,t^3 + 0.9\,t^2 - 1.5\,t + 4
      </latex>
      What is the instantaneous velocity of the robot at <latex>t = 2</latex> seconds?
      Keep the sign of your answer positive toward the right end.

             </latex>
          3. **Take the limit as <latex>\Delta t \to 0</latex>:**
             This is equivalent to finding the derivative of <latex>d(t)</latex> at <latex>t = 2</latex>.
          4. **Final Answer:**
             The instantaneous velocity of the robot at <latex>t = 2\,\mathrm{s}</latex> is
             <latex>v(2) = 0.90\,\mathrm{m/s}</latex>.
